# Hull Ch. 1 Notes (pp. 23–41)

## Exchange-traded vs OTC
- Exchange-traded contracts are standardized and typically cleared via a central counterparty (CCP).
- Clearing + margining reduce counterparty credit exposure, but introduce liquidity/margin-call dynamics.

## Clearinghouse & margin intuition
- Initial margin is posted up front; variation margin reflects daily PnL via marking to market.
- Margin systems transform credit risk into liquidity risk (cash needs during adverse moves).

## Market size measurement
- OTC notional can look “huge” relative to exchange-traded, but notional ≠ economic exposure.
- Market value / MTM is the better concept for “how much is actually at risk today,” though it still isn’t tail risk.

## Contract types & participants
- Forwards/futures are obligations; options are rights.
- Hedgers, speculators, arbitrageurs interact to create liquidity and enforce no-arbitrage relationships.

## “Dangers”
- Real risk questions: (1) what can go wrong? (2) how much can we lose?
- Operational and liquidity dynamics can dominate model error during stress.
