# Options Desk Risk

This repository contains Python implementations of core derivatives pricing, hedging,
and risk concepts inspired by *Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives* (John C. Hull),
developed from the perspective of a trading desk risk manager.

The focus is on:
- Correct market conventions (day count, compounding, discounting)
- Transparent pricing and sensitivity calculations
- Hedging mechanics and P&L behavior under scenarios
- Building reusable, tested risk analytics rather than one-off scripts
